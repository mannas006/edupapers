# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX: Deploy PDF Processor for Vercel

## The Problem
Your Vercel app shows "PDF processor not found" because Vercel can't run Python apps. You need to deploy the PDF processor separately.

## ðŸš€ FASTEST SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway (Free)

```bash
# Navigate to PDF processor directory
cd "PDF Question Processor"

# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables in Railway
In the Railway dashboard, add these variables:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://ipmzxaxyffamuvbpglzq.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key-from-supabase
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD_1l8qu0kEaxK0tNY4cE4zXIFxkH50giw
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-random-secret
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://edupapers-12ixy0e89-mannas006s-projects.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variable
In your Vercel dashboard, add:

```
VITE_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app/webhook/process-pdf
```

### Step 4: Redeploy Vercel
```bash
# In your main project directory
vercel --prod
```
