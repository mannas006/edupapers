# 🤖 PDF Processing Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The PDF processing functionality has been successfully integrated into the EduPapers upload system. When users upload PDF files, the system can automatically extract questions using AI.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Upload Component
- **Auto PDF Processing Toggle**: Users can enable/disable AI question extraction
- **Real-time Processing Status**: Live updates on processing progress
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators, success/error states
- **File Type Support**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG up to 2MB

### 2. PDF Processor API Server
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `POST /webhook/process-pdf`
- **Status Tracking**: `GET /status/:processing_id`
- **Health Check**: `GET /health`
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking PDF processing
- **File Download**: Automatic PDF retrieval from URLs

### 3. Processing Workflow
```
User Uploads PDF → Store in Supabase → Trigger Processing → Download PDF → Extract Questions → Store Results → Notify User
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start PDF Processor API
npm run pdf-processor

# Terminal 2: Start Main App
npm run dev

# Or run both simultaneously
npm run dev-with-processor
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Update `.env` file:
```env
# PDF Processor Configuration
REACT_APP_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:8000/webhook/process-pdf
```

Update `PDF Question Processor/.env` file:
```env
# Google Gemini API Key for PDF processing
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### 3. Upload a PDF
1. Go to the Upload page
2. Enable "🤖 Auto-extract questions using AI"
3. Fill in university details
4. Upload a PDF file
5. Watch the processing status in real-time

## 📁 File Structure Changes

```
Question-Paper-Organizer/
├── src/pages/Upload.tsx          # ✅ Enhanced with PDF processing
├── server/pdf-processor.js       # ✅ New PDF processing API
├── .env                          # ✅ Updated with webhook URL
└── package.json                  # ✅ Added processing scripts
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Processing Status Flow
1. **uploading**: File being uploaded to Supabase
2. **queued**: Processing request queued
3. **downloading**: PDF being downloaded from URL
4. **processing**: AI extracting questions
5. **completed**: Processing finished successfully
6. **failed**: Processing encountered an error

### API Endpoints

#### Process PDF
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/process-pdf
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "file_url": "https://example.com/file.pdf",
  "filename": "test.pdf",
  "metadata": {
    "semester": "SEM-1",
    "subject_name": "Mathematics",
    "university": "MIT",
    "course": "Engineering",
    "year": 2024
  }
}
```

#### Check Processing Status
```bash
GET http://localhost:8000/status/{processing_id}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Processor Not Starting**
   - Ensure Python dependencies are installed: `pip3 install -r PDF\ Question\ Processor/config/requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version: `python3 --version`

2. **Gemini API Errors**
   - Set your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `PDF Question Processor/.env`
   - Get API key from: https://ai.google.dev/

3. **Processing Timeout**
   - Large PDFs may take longer to process
   - Default timeout is 5 minutes (300 seconds)

4. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check Supabase configuration
   - Verify file size (max 2MB)
   - Ensure file permissions

### Logs and Debugging
- PDF Processor logs: Check terminal running `npm run pdf-processor`
- Network requests: Check browser developer tools
- Processing status: Monitor via status endpoint

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**: Store extracted questions directly in Supabase
2. **Question Editing**: Allow users to edit extracted questions
3. **Batch Processing**: Support multiple file uploads
4. **Advanced AI**: Implement answer generation and explanations
5. **Question Types**: Support MCQ, fill-in-the-blank, etc.

## 📊 Processing Results

When processing completes successfully, the system:
- Shows number of questions extracted
- Saves results to `PDF Question Processor/output/`
- Updates processing status to "completed"
- Displays success notification

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- File uploads are limited to 2MB
- Only authenticated users can upload
- API includes basic validation
- Temporary files are cleaned up after processing

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set Up Gemini API Key**: Get your API key and update the environment file
2. **Test with Sample PDF**: Upload a question paper PDF to test the functionality
3. **Monitor Processing**: Watch the real-time status updates
4. **Customize UI**: Adjust the interface based on user feedback
