## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. CSS Configuration Issue
**Problem**: After reorganization, CSS wasn't loading
**Root Cause**: PostCSS and Tailwind config paths broken
**Solution**: 
- Updated Vite configuration for PostCSS path
- Fixed ES module compatibility in PostCSS config
- Added proper Tailwind config references

### 2. PDF Processor Connection Issue
**Problem**: Backend service failing to connect
**Root Cause**: Missing environment variables causing server exit
**Solution**:
- Changed from hard crash to graceful warnings
- Enabled operation without Supabase integration
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. TypeScript Environment Variables
**Problem**: Environment variable types not defined
**Root Cause**: Missing ImportMeta interface definitions
**Solution**:
- Updated `vite-env.d.ts` with proper type definitions
- Added all required environment variable types
