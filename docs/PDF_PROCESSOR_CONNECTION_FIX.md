# PDF Processor Connection Issue - RESOLVED

## 🐛 Issue Description
After reorganizing project files, the PDF processing service was failing to connect, resulting in:
```
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
Error triggering PDF processing: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Failed to connect to PDF processing service
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Variables**: PDF processor was exiting due to missing Supabase environment variables
2. **Process Management**: When run through `concurrently`, the PDF processor would exit immediately
3. **Server Startup**: Process.exit(1) was being called when environment variables were missing

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Handling (`server/pdf-processor.js`)
```javascript
// Before: Hard exit on missing env vars
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseKey) {
    console.error('Missing Supabase environment variables');
    process.exit(1); // This was causing the server to crash
}

// After: Graceful handling with warnings
if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseKey) {
    console.warn('⚠️  Warning: Missing Supabase environment variables');
    console.warn('📝 PDF processing will work without Supabase integration');
    console.warn('🔧 Create a .env file with Supabase credentials to enable full functionality');
}

const supabase = supabaseUrl && supabaseKey ? createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey) : null;
```

### 2. Server Startup Process
- Removed hard exit on missing environment variables
- Added graceful degradation for missing Supabase integration
- PDF processing functionality works independently of database integration

### 3. Development Workflow
```bash
# Option 1: Run both servers manually
node server/pdf-processor.js &
npm run dev

# Option 2: Use the npm script (may need manual restart of PDF processor)
npm run dev-with-processor
```

## 🧪 Verification Steps
1. ✅ PDF Processor Health Check: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. ✅ Frontend Accessibility: `http://localhost:5173`
3. ✅ Upload Functionality: PDF upload form should work without connection errors

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ **Frontend Server**: Running on `http://localhost:5173`
- ✅ **PDF Processor**: Running on port `8000`
- ✅ **API Connectivity**: Health endpoint responding correctly
- ✅ **Upload Service**: Ready to process PDF files

## 🔧 Environment Setup (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the project root for full Supabase integration:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## 📈 Next Steps
- PDF processing should now work correctly
- Upload functionality restored
- Both development servers operational
- Ready for continued development and testing

**Status: RESOLVED ✅**
